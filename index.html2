  <li><i>Gaint Malamute Husky</i></li>
  <p>The Inuit's giant 'sled dogs' were as tall as 35" and weighed over 190lbs. These giant Malamutes were known to be the largest and strongest sled pullers and pack animals.</p>

  <li><i>Alaskan Malamute</i></li>
  <p>The Alaskan Malamute features a powerful, sturdy body built for stamina and strength. It reigns as one of the oldest dog breeds whose original looks have not been significantly altered. This intelligent canine needs a job and consistent leadership to avoid becoming bored or challenging to handle.</p>

  <li><i>Siberian Husky</i></li>
  <p>Siberian Huskies are strong, compact, working sled dogs. The medium-sized head is in proportion to the body, with a muzzle that is equal in length to the skull, with a well-defined stop</p>

  <li><i>Labrador Husky</i></li>
  <p>Labrador Huskies have a combination of strength, intelligence and stamina, properties that are good for virtually any breed. They are not as fast as their<br>Siberian or Alaskan cousins because they have been bred for endurance and strength.</p>
